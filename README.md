# Stop Loss Grid

Using a grid stragtegy from Expert4x (https://expert4x.com/) and shown in several YouTube videos by Expert4x including https://youtu.be/8jtWfmUVyWk

This approach removes the possibility of unlimited drawdowns in the case of a strong trend but does introduce losses at the stop loss point.

The code here is true to the principles of the strategy although there could be some improvements in implementation which
may appear in a later tutorial.
